# The Problem 

The interest in cryptocurrency investments has skyrocked in the past year. However, the vast majority of investors have little experience with and knowledge of the technical aspects and development measures that are indicative of promising cryptocurrency projects. 

The developer barrier is a widely recognized problem throughout the blockchain and decentralized development community. As the community pushes towards a more meritocratic and regulation free financial world through the use of cryptocurrencis, those without technical knowledge are left without an informative platform that measures the legitamacy of these technologies. For the advancement of knowledgeable cryptocurrencies, there must be a platform that reduces the barrier of entry into undrestanding these measure. 

# Introducing CoinChk

We've built a next-generation information tool for speculative and non-technical cryptocurrency investors. Rather than scraping and parsing speculative data from non-technical journalists and social media, we've relied strictly on the source of developmental progress to form our calculations: the respective project's Githubs. 

CoinChk bridges the gap between non-technical crypto-enthusiasts and technical projects with an unprecedented approach.
